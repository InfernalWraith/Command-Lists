Comments in C can be made by using // for a single line or /*  */ for a multi-line comment:

//This is a single line comment

/* This is a 
multi-line comment */

In order to make life easier and use pre-existing functions, we need to include the libraries which contain them like so:

#include <iostream>		//Contains the basic functions such as printing text and data input
#include <vector>		//Contains functions for working with vectors
#include <string>		//For working with strings
#include <fstream>		//Used for working with files
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Every C++ program needs to contain a function called "main"

int main(){
	//YOUR CODE HERE
	return 0;
}

The main function needs to end with the command "return 0" which says the program executed without any problems.

We can initialize variables and designate which kind of value they can be like so:

int Variable1;
float var2;						//For real numbers, accurate to around the 6th decimal
const double PI = 3.14159;		//"const" means the variable has a fixed value and can't be altered, double>float
char letter = 'A';
bool works = true;				//Is also equal to 1;
bool fails = false;				//Is also equal to 0;

We can print things out like so:
