CSS is a language designed to be used alongside HTML. 
Its purpose is to add to the aesthetic design of the page, changing the style and positioning of various elements.

We can change the style of ALL tags of a certain type by using the <style> </style> tag.
It is placed above our HTML code like so:

<style>
    h2 {color: red;}
</style>

This will change all h2 tags to a red color. 
It is very important to add both the opening and the closing brackets, as well as the semicolon when adding a property.

We can also assign multiple properties to a single class, which can be reused whenever we want:

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

We use it later on in the code like this:

<ANYTAG class="blue-text">
