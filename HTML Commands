HTML is unique in the sense that its commands are written inside tags ( < > ).
Example:   <html> </html>

As you can see, the tags "nest," so you need to close them after opening them, just like brackets.
The tags' area of influence is between the lines where you open the tag and where you close it.

Every HTML document needs to start with the following line:
<!DOCTYPE html>

This tells the browser that the following code is written in the HTML programming language.
After that, we type <html> and we place our entire code there, putting a </html> at the very end of our code, marking the
end of our website.

The <head> tag serves as a place where we place general information about our website.
Inside the <head> tag, we can add the <title> tag, inside which we write in the name of our website.

The <body> tag is where we put the contents of our website.
