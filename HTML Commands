BASICS:

Every HTML document needs to start with the following line:
<!DOCTYPE html>

This tells the browser that the following code is written in the HTML programming language.
After that, we type <html> and we place our entire code there, putting a </html> at the very end of our code, marking the
end of our website.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
TAGS:

HTML is unique in the sense that its commands are written inside tags ( < > ).
Example:   <html> </html>

As you can see, the tags "nest," so you need to close them after opening them, just like brackets.
The tags' area of influence is between the lines where you open the tag and where you close it.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The <head> tag serves as a place where we place general information about our website.

Inside the <head> tag, we can add the <title> tag, inside which we write in the name of our website.

The <body> tag is where we put the contents of our website.

Inside the <body> tag, we can designate paragraphs by using the <p> tag.

Headings for our paragraphs can be formed using the <hX> tag, where X is any number from 1 to 6, where 6 has the smallest font.

We can insert hyperlinks into our code by using the tag <a href="http://www.examplelink.com"> and close it later with </a>
Other things besides text can be made links as well by inserting images or other content before closing the tag.

Images are inserted like so: <img src="http://www.imagehosting.com/exampleimage.jpg" />

Comments can be created like so: <!-- EXAMPLE COMMENT -->
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
LISTS:

The tag <ol> begins an ordered list. The items inside can be numbered by adding a <li> tag (and closing it later).

If we just want a list without numbering the items inside, we use the <ul> tag, followed by <li> tags for individual items.

Lists can also nest, that way we can put a list inside a list.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
STYLING:
We can format the font size of the tags and paragraphs by using: 
<p style="font-size: Xpx"> where X is the font size (number)

We can also change the text color like so: 
<ANYTAG style="color: X"> where X is any valid color. 
A list of colors can be found at: https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color

We can also change both the font size and the color at the same time by using:
<ANYTAG style="color: X; font-size: Y"> where X is any valid color and Y is any positive number (integer).

You may also adjust the font type like so: 
<ANYTAG style="font-family: X"> where X is any valid font.
A list of fonts can eb found at: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#generic-font-families

We can set the background color of a certain paragraph/list, or even of the entire document like so:
<ANYTAG style="background-color: X"> where X is any valid color

We can align the text to the left, right, or even center it by using:
<ANYTAG style="text-align: X"> where X is either "left" "right" or "center"

Regarding text, we can bold it using the <strong> tag.
We can emphasize it in italics with the <em> tag.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
TABLES:
Tables are created with the <table> tag.
We can add rows to the table with the <tr> tag.
We add things to the table using the table data tag - <td>
We can further format the table using the <thead> and <tbody> tags. They function like the normal <body> and <head> tags.
The thickness of the table border is changed with the <table border="Xpx"> where X is any positive integer.
Headings for the table can be created using the <th> command. This is used to designate what a column is all about.
If we want to have our header take up multiple columns of space, use the <th colspan="X"> where X is the number of columns.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We can divide our website into smaller portions by using the <div> tag.
We can chance the <div> tag's width and height, as well as its background color like so:
<div style="width: Xpx; height: Ypx; background-color: Z"> where X and Y are any positive integers, and Z is any valid color.

For smaller sections of our website, such as text, we can use the <span> tag. 
This allows us to make styling changes to a certain part of the text inside the <span> </span> tags.
text inside it.

In HTML, we sometimes may want to include extermal resources to our website (resources outside of the code block).
We can do that using the <link> tag:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="theme.css">

For example, this command would link the HTML code with the "theme.css" document.
This would allow the HTML and CSS to combine when the code runs, while still remaining seperate documents.

The <link> tag can also be used to import web links:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

This command would grab the "Lobster" font and allow us to use it later on in our website.
