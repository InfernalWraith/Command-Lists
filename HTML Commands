HTML is unique in the sense that its commands are written inside tags ( < > ).
Example:   <html> </html>

As you can see, the tags "nest," so you need to close them after opening them, just like brackets.
The tags' area of influence is between the lines where you open the tag and where you close it.

Every HTML document needs to start with the following line:
<!DOCTYPE html>

This tells the browser that the following code is written in the HTML programming language.
After that, we type <html> and we place our entire code there, putting a </html> at the very end of our code, marking the
end of our website.

The <head> tag serves as a place where we place general information about our website.

Inside the <head> tag, we can add the <title> tag, inside which we write in the name of our website.

The <body> tag is where we put the contents of our website.

Inside the <body> tag, we can designate paragraphs by using the <p> tag.

STYLING:
We can format the font size of the tags and paragraphs by using: 
<p style="font-size: Xpx"> where X is the font size (number)

We can also change the text color like so: 
<ANYTAG style="color: X"> where X is any valid color. 
A list of colors can be found at: https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color

We can also change both the font size and the color at the same time by using:
<ANYTAG style="color: X; font-size: Y"> where X is any valid color and Y is any positive number (integer).

You may also adjust the font type like so: 
<ANYTAG style="font-family: X"> where X is any valid font.
A list of fonts can eb found at: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#generic-font-families

We can set the background color of a certain paragraph/list, or even of the entire document like so:
<ANYTAG style="background-color: X"> where X is any valid color

We can align the text to the left, right, or even center it by using:
<ANYTAG style="text-align: X"> where X is either "left" "right" or "center"

Regarding text, we can bold it using the <strong> tag.
We can emphasize it in italics with the <em> tag.

Headings for our paragraphs can be formed using the <hX> tag, where X is any number from 1 to 6, where 6 has the smallest font.

We can insert hyperlinks into our code by using the <a href="http://www.examplelink.com">Here's an example link!</a>
Other things besides text can be made links as well by inserting images or other content before closing the tag.
If we make an image a link, we don't add the description (here it's "Here's an example link")

Images are inserted like so: <img src="http://www.imagehosting.com/exampleimage.jpg" />

The tag <ol> begins an ordered list. The items inside can be numbered by adding a <li> tag (and closing it later).

If we just want a list without numbering the items inside, we use the <ul> tag, followed by <li> tags for individual items.

Comments can be created like so: <!-- EXAMPLE COMMENT -->
